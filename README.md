### Project Title :
Pharmacy Management System
<br><br>

### Problem Statement/Opportunity :
Pharmacy management has kept paper record in filing cabinets. Managing a very large pharmacy with records on papers will be tedious and difficult to keep track of inventories with regards to the drugs in the store, expiry date, quantity of drugs available based on the categories and their functions. The pharmacist has to order drugs to replenish the already diminishing stock. In addition, ordering of drugs is being carried out manually. Significant amount of time is allocated for writing the order as the pharmacist needs to go through the stock balance and make rough estimate of the amount to order based on figures. The pharmacist has to order drugs to replenish the already diminishing stock. In addition, ordering of drugs is being carried out manually. The set-up of this pharmacy management system will ensure availability of sufficient quantity of drugs and consumable materials for the patient.

### Azure Technology :
Azure App Service, Web App

1. Azure App Service<br>
   Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET,.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

   App Service not only adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. You can also  take advantage of its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.

   With App Service, you pay for the Azure compute resources you use. The compute resources you use are determined by the App Service plan that you run your apps on.

2. Web App<br>
   Azure Web App service lets us quickly build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform. It helps us to meet rigorous performance, scalability, security, and compliance requirements while using a fully managed platform to perform infrastructure maintenance.
